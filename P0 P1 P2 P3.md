In SRE, incidents are typically categorized by severity levels—P0, P1, P2, and P3—based on their impact on users and the business. Here's an explanation of each with examples:

### **P0 (Critical/Highest Priority)**
- **Definition**: System-wide outages or major failures that affect a large number of users or critical business functions. Requires immediate action to restore service.
- **Examples**:
  - **Complete Production Outage**: The entire service or website is down, affecting all users (e.g., a global outage of an e-commerce platform during Black Friday).
  - **Critical API Failure**: The core API that supports your service is unavailable, stopping all functionality.
  - **Database Corruption**: Loss of critical data or corruption in the main production database.

  **Response**: Immediate, all-hands-on-deck approach, with senior engineers and leadership involvement. Incident management processes, such as paging, are triggered immediately.

### **P1 (High Priority)**
- **Definition**: Major functional issues or partial outages that affect many users but don’t bring the entire system down. Still very urgent but not as widespread as P0.
- **Examples**:
  - **Degraded Performance**: Users are experiencing very slow response times, but the system is still functional (e.g., website load times are 10x slower than normal).
  - **Partial Service Outage**: A critical part of the service (e.g., payments gateway or user authentication) is down for a large group of users.
  - **Data Inconsistency**: Key user data is unavailable or delayed, but the service is otherwise working (e.g., account balances not being updated in real-time for banking).

  **Response**: High priority, but teams have slightly more time (minutes to an hour) to diagnose and resolve. Still requires a fast response and resolution.

### **P2 (Moderate Priority)**
- **Definition**: Minor functionality is affected, but core services are operational. Typically affects a small number of users or non-critical services.
- **Examples**:
  - **Minor Bug in User Interface**: A non-essential feature (e.g., a dropdown not working properly) is broken, but core functionality remains intact.
  - **Intermittent Failures**: Some users occasionally experience errors, but retrying usually works.
  - **Non-Critical API Failure**: An API used for non-essential functionality (e.g., a recommendation system) is down.

  **Response**: Medium priority, to be addressed within the business day, but does not require immediate attention. Can wait for normal working hours.

### **P3 (Low Priority)**
- **Definition**: Cosmetic issues, small bugs, or requests for improvements that do not impact the core functionality of the service.
- **Examples**:
  - **UI Alignment Issues**: Buttons or text slightly misaligned, but no impact on functionality.
  - **Minor Inconveniences**: Minor inconveniences in the workflow (e.g., a feature takes an extra click to access).
  - **Documentation Errors**: Inaccuracies or outdated content in user guides or internal documentation.

  **Response**: Low priority, can be addressed as part of routine maintenance or during regular sprints. Does not require urgent action.

### **Summary of Response Times**:
- **P0**: Immediate (minutes)
- **P1**: Urgent (within an hour)
- **P2**: Scheduled (within a business day or week)
- **P3**: Low priority (in regular sprint cycles)

These priorities help teams quickly assess and allocate resources to incidents based on business impact.
