In the context of incident management, Python can be used to automate several tasks to reduce response times, improve reliability, and ensure consistent handling of incidents. Here are some examples of incident-related automations using Python:

### 1. **Automated Incident Detection and Alerting**
   - **Log Monitoring and Alerting:**
     - Monitor logs for specific patterns or errors and automatically trigger alerts when issues are detected.
     - Example:
     ```python
     import re
     import smtplib
     from email.mime.text import MIMEText

     def send_alert(subject, body):
         msg = MIMEText(body)
         msg['Subject'] = subject
         msg['From'] = "monitoring@example.com"
         msg['To'] = "oncall@example.com"

         with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.example.com') as server:
             server.send_message(msg)

     with open('/var/log/app.log', 'r') as f:
         for line in f:
             if re.search("ERROR|CRITICAL", line):
                 send_alert("Critical Error Detected", line)
     ```

### 2. **Automatic Incident Response (Self-Healing)**
   - **Service Restart on Failure:**
     - Automatically detect when a service has failed and restart it.
     - Example using `subprocess` to restart a service:
     ```python
     import subprocess

     def restart_service(service_name):
         subprocess.run(["sudo", "systemctl", "restart", service_name])

     with open('/var/log/app.log', 'r') as f:
         for line in f:
             if "Service failed" in line:
                 restart_service('my_service')
                 break
     ```

### 3. **Automated Incident Logging and Ticketing**
   - **Create Incident Tickets Automatically:**
     - Automate the creation of incident tickets in systems like Jira or ServiceNow when certain conditions are met.
     - Example using `requests` to create a Jira ticket:
     ```python
     import requests
     import json

     def create_jira_ticket(summary, description):
         url = "https://jira.example.com/rest/api/2/issue"
         headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
         payload = {
             "fields": {
                 "project": {"key": "PROJ"},
                 "summary": summary,
                 "description": description,
                 "issuetype": {"name": "Incident"}
             }
         }
         response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload), auth=('user', 'pass'))
         if response.status_code == 201:
             print("Incident ticket created:", response.json()['key'])

     log_file = '/var/log/app.log'
     with open(log_file, 'r') as f:
         for line in f:
             if "ERROR" in line:
                 create_jira_ticket("Error Detected in Application", line)
                 break
     ```

### 4. **Automated Incident Communication**
   - **Notify Teams via Chat or Email:**
     - Send automated notifications to relevant teams through chat platforms (like Slack) or email when an incident occurs.
     - Example using `slack_sdk` to send a message to Slack:
     ```python
     from slack_sdk import WebClient

     client = WebClient(token="your-slack-bot-token")

     def notify_slack(channel, message):
         response = client.chat_postMessage(channel=channel, text=message)
         if response['ok']:
             print("Notification sent to Slack")

     with open('/var/log/app.log', 'r') as f:
         for line in f:
             if "CRITICAL" in line:
                 notify_slack('#incident-response', f"Critical issue detected: {line}")
                 break
     ```

### 5. **Incident Data Collection and Analysis**
   - **Automated Data Collection for Post-Incident Analysis:**
     - Collect logs, metrics, and other relevant data automatically when an incident is detected for later analysis.
     - Example of collecting and saving logs during an incident:
     ```python
     import shutil

     def collect_incident_data(log_file, incident_marker):
         with open(log_file, 'r') as f:
             lines = f.readlines()

         incident_logs = [line for line in lines if incident_marker in line]
         with open('incident_data.log', 'w') as f:
             f.writelines(incident_logs)

     collect_incident_data('/var/log/app.log', 'CRITICAL')
     ```

### 6. **Automated Remediation Scripts**
   - **Scripted Responses to Known Issues:**
     - Run predefined scripts to handle known issues automatically (e.g., clearing a cache, reconfiguring a service).
     - Example:
     ```python
     def clear_cache():
         subprocess.run(["sudo", "rm", "-rf", "/var/cache/my_service/*"])
         subprocess.run(["sudo", "systemctl", "restart", "my_service"])

     with open('/var/log/app.log', 'r') as f:
         for line in f:
             if "Cache corruption" in line:
                 clear_cache()
                 break
     ```

### 7. **Incident Metrics and Reporting**
   - **Automated Reporting on Incident Metrics:**
     - Generate and send reports on incident metrics (e.g., number of incidents, resolution time) on a regular basis.
     - Example using `matplotlib` for report generation:
     ```python
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

     incidents = {
         '2024-08-01': 5,
         '2024-08-02': 3,
         '2024-08-03': 7,
         '2024-08-04': 2
     }

     dates = list(incidents.keys())
     counts = list(incidents.values())

     plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
     plt.bar(dates, counts, color='red')
     plt.xlabel('Date')
     plt.ylabel('Number of Incidents')
     plt.title('Daily Incident Report')
     plt.savefig('incident_report.png')
     ```

### 8. **Incident Recovery Automation**
   - **Automated Failover:**
     - Automatically trigger failover processes when a primary service or resource becomes unavailable.
     - Example using `boto3` to change Route 53 DNS records:
     ```python
     import boto3

     client = boto3.client('route53')

     def failover_to_backup():
         response = client.change_resource_record_sets(
             HostedZoneId='Z1234567890',
             ChangeBatch={
                 'Changes': [
                     {
                         'Action': 'UPSERT',
                         'ResourceRecordSet': {
                             'Name': 'service.example.com',
                             'Type': 'A',
                             'TTL': 60,
                             'ResourceRecords': [{'Value': '192.168.1.2'}]  # Backup IP
                         }
                     }
                 ]
             }
         )
         print("Failover to backup IP triggered.")

     with open('/var/log/app.log', 'r') as f:
         for line in f:
             if "Primary service unavailable" in line:
                 failover_to_backup()
                 break
     ```

### 9. **Incident Status Dashboard Updates**
   - **Automatic Dashboard Updates:**
     - Update incident dashboards automatically based on real-time data.
     - Example using `python-grafana-api` to update Grafana dashboard annotations:
     ```python
     from grafana_api.grafana_face import GrafanaFace

     grafana = GrafanaFace(auth='Bearer your-api-key', host='grafana.example.com')

     def add_incident_annotation(dashboard_id, text):
         grafana.annotation.create_annotation(dashboardId=dashboard_id, text=text)

     with open('/var/log/app.log', 'r') as f:
         for line in f:
             if "CRITICAL" in line:
                 add_incident_annotation(1, "Critical incident detected.")
                 break
     ```

### 10. **Automated Incident Escalation**
   - **Escalation Based on Incident Severity:**
     - Automatically escalate incidents to higher-level support based on severity or duration.
     - Example using `requests` to escalate to a higher-level on-call:
     ```python
     import requests

     def escalate_incident(incident_id):
         url = f"https://incident-management.example.com/incidents/{incident_id}/escalate"
         response = requests.post(url, auth=('user', 'pass'))
         if response.status_code == 200:
             print("Incident escalated successfully.")

     with open('/var/log/app.log', 'r') as f:
         for line in f:
             if "CRITICAL" in line:
                 escalate_incident(incident_id="12345")
                 break
     ```

These examples show how Python can be used to automate various tasks in incident management, from detection and alerting to remediation, reporting, and escalation. By automating these processes, SREs can reduce response times, ensure consistent handling of incidents, and minimize the impact of issues on users. **`Though for few things tools are also available to run at scale so better use them rather writting python scripts.`**
