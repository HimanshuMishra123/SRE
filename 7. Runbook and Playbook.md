In Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), **runbooks** and **playbooks** serve as structured documents that help engineers resolve incidents or perform routine tasks efficiently and consistently. They are both important tools for incident management and automation in SRE, but they differ in purpose and scope.

### 1. **Runbook:**
A runbook is a step-by-step guide used for `responding to known operational issues or performing routine operational tasks`. It provides instructions on **how** to resolve incidents or perform tasks, typically aimed at ensuring reliability and consistency in procedures.

#### Characteristics:
- Contains predefined procedures for common operational tasks (e.g., restarting a service, investigating a disk failure).
- Designed for low-skill tasks or repetitive tasks that do not require much problem-solving.
- Typically used in automated systems or for human reference in manual tasks.

#### Example Runbook:
**Task:** Restarting a web service when it becomes unresponsive.
```
1. Log in to the server where the service is hosted.
2. Run `sudo systemctl status nginx` to check if the service is running.
3. If the service is not running, restart it with `sudo systemctl restart nginx`.
4. Verify that the service is back up by visiting the web page or checking logs: `tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log`.
5. Escalate the issue if the service does not restart or continues to fail.
```

### 2. **Playbook:**
A playbook, on the other hand, is a `more strategic document` that outlines **what actions to take** during incidents, typically offering multiple scenarios and decision paths based on the specific problem. It often serves as a `higher-level guide for responding to complex issues` and may include troubleshooting procedures for various situations.

#### Characteristics:
- Designed for complex incidents where multiple actions might be necessary.
- Focuses on diagnosing and fixing unknown or less predictable issues.
- May include branches or decision-making based on different outcomes during troubleshooting.

#### Example Playbook:
**Scenario:** High latency detected in a microservices-based application.
```
1. **Check Application Logs:**
   - Access logs of the affected microservice using `kubectl logs`.
   - Look for errors related to timeouts or database queries.

2. **Check Resource Utilization:**
   - Verify CPU, memory, and disk I/O usage of the affected pod using `kubectl top pod`.
   - Check whether any pods are throttling resources.

3. **Network Troubleshooting:**
   - Check for network latency using `kubectl exec <pod> -- ping <service>` or with network tools like Kubeshark.
   - Use eBPF tools to trace network bottlenecks.

4. **Database Latency:**
   - Check the database response times using metrics from Prometheus or an APM tool like Datadog.

5. **Mitigation:**
   - Scale up the affected service using `kubectl scale deployment <deployment> --replicas=<desired_count>`.
   - Restart the pod or service if necessary.
   - Escalate the issue if resource scaling doesn’t resolve the problem.
```

### Summary:
- **Runbooks** are straightforward, task-based guides for predictable and well-defined issues.
- **Playbooks** are more flexible and provide strategies to handle complex, unpredictable incidents.

Both help SRE teams ensure incidents are handled quickly, consistently, and efficiently, reducing downtime and preventing incidents from escalating.

## **Ques. Can we automate the incident response (resolve issue) using runbook and playbook?**
Yes, automating incident response using **runbooks** and **playbooks** is a common practice in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). Automation can drastically improve response times, reduce human error, and increase the overall reliability of systems. **Runbooks** are often highly automatable for routine tasks, while **Playbooks** can be partially automated with automated decision points and escalation triggers, combining automation with human oversight for complex scenarios.

These days there are many **tools for SRE Incident Response** like `incident.io`, `Blameless`, `root.ly`, `FireHydrant`, etc. <br/>
`PagerDuty` also has a lot of built-in incident response capabilities. <br/>
Within those tools you can define playbooks / runbooks, checklists, escalations, communication flows, API / monitoring integrations and so on. <br/>

Here’s how automation can be applied to both runbooks and playbooks: <br/>

### 1. **Automating Runbook Actions:**
Runbooks typically involve well-defined, repeatable tasks that are prime candidates for automation. You can automate the steps outlined in a runbook to handle routine operational tasks or minor incidents without requiring human intervention.

#### Example Automation:
In many cases, SREs use runbook automation tools to streamline incident management and response processes. However, the decision to generate Jira tickets—or other types of tracking issues—depends on the specific workflow and policies of the organization.

**Here’s a breakdown of how runbook automation and Jira tickets might intersect:**

1. **Runbook Automation:**
   - **Incident Response:** Automation tools can execute predefined steps to resolve incidents based on runbooks, which might include scripts or commands to fix issues or mitigate problems.
   - **Documentation:** Some tools automatically document the incident and actions taken, which can be useful for creating post-incident reports.

2. **Jira Tickets:**
   - **Tracking and Accountability:** Jira tickets are often used to track incidents, manage tasks, and assign responsibilities. Even if a runbook handles the resolution, a Jira ticket might still be created to ensure that all actions are logged and that follow-up tasks or investigations are assigned and tracked.
   - **Integration:** Many organizations integrate runbook automation tools with Jira, so that tickets are created automatically based on incident triggers or actions taken by the runbook.

In summary, while runbook automation tools can handle many aspects of incident resolution, Jira tickets might still be used for tracking, accountability, and follow-up tasks. Integration between automation tools and ticketing systems can help streamline this process.

- **Service Restarts:** A monitoring system (like Prometheus with Alertmanager) detects that a service is down. Instead of a human manually following the steps in the runbook, an automated script or job can trigger the steps:
  - The alert triggers a script that checks the service status.
  - If the service is down, the script automatically restarts the service.
  - The system verifies if the service is back up and sends a notification to the team.

This type of automation is often implemented using tools like:
- **Runbook Automation (RBA) tools** like PagerDuty Runbook Automation, Opsgenie (Atlassian), Splunk On-Call, AWS Systems Manager Automation etc.
- **Ansible** for automating infrastructure tasks.
- **AWS Lambda** for cloud-based automation.


#### Example:
For a web server down incident, a runbook can be automated with the following flow:
```
1. Monitor tool detects service down.
2. Trigger a script that restarts the service automatically.
3. After restart, validate if the service is functioning correctly.
4. Notify on-call engineer of the resolution, or escalate if unresolved.
```

### 2. **Automating Playbook-Based Responses:**
Playbooks, being more complex and requiring decisions based on different conditions, can still be partially automated. This involves automating the steps that require minimal decision-making, while leaving critical decision points for human operators.

#### Example Automation:
- **Incident Triage:** When an alert is triggered, automated scripts can gather relevant information (logs, metrics, system health, etc.) and present it to the SRE on-call. Based on predefined criteria, the system may:
  - Automatically scale up resources if utilization is too high.
  - Run diagnostic commands to detect network or database issues.
  - Perform basic remediation steps, such as restarting services or scaling components.
  - Escalate the incident to a human if the situation doesn't resolve with the automated steps.

#### Decision Tree Automation:
For complex incidents where multiple factors are at play, an automated system can follow a decision tree similar to a playbook:
- **Step 1:** If high CPU usage, scale up service.
- **Step 2:** If network latency is detected, run a traceroute and alert the network team.
- **Step 3:** If the database query response is slow, flush cache and retry.

This automation may be triggered using:
- **Runbooks with conditional logic** that dynamically execute based on metrics.
- **AI/ML-based monitoring tools** that predict and resolve incidents without human intervention (e.g., Datadog, Dynatrace, or Moogsoft).
- **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools** like Terraform with auto-remediation.

### Benefits of Automating Incident Response:
- **Faster Resolution:** Automated systems can react instantly when an incident occurs, reducing downtime.
- **Consistency:** Tasks are performed the same way every time, ensuring that no step is missed.
- **Reduced Human Intervention:** Automation reduces the need for on-call engineers to manually execute tasks for routine or predictable incidents.
- **Escalation Control:** Automated systems can escalate issues only when human decision-making is required, allowing for a more efficient allocation of resources.

### Human-in-the-Loop for Complex Automation:
While automation can handle many incidents, there will still be cases where human expertise is needed to make complex decisions. SREs often use a combination of automated actions (for known issues) and manual steps (for more intricate problems) to manage incidents effectively.

In summary, **runbooks** are often highly automatable for routine tasks, while **playbooks** can be partially automated with automated decision points and escalation triggers, combining automation with human oversight for complex scenarios.
