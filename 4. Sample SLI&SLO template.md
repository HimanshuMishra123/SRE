### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Service Level Objectives (SLO) and Service Level Indicators (SLI) for the XYZ Customer Portal, a critical customer-facing application that provides users with access to their accounts, services, and support. The SLOs are set to ensure that the application delivers a high-quality user experience, and the SLIs are metrics used to measure the performance of the service against the defined SLOs.

### 2. Service Overview

- **Service Name:** XYZ Customer Portal
- **Service Description:** An online platform that allows customers to manage their accounts, view service details, make payments, and access support.
- **Users:** Retail customers of XYZ Corp.
- **Criticality:** High (business-critical application)

### 3. Service Level Indicators (SLI)

SLIs are specific metrics that measure the performance and reliability of the service. For the XYZ Customer Portal, the following SLIs have been defined:

#### 3.1 Availability

- **Definition:** Percentage of time the application is accessible and functional for users.
- **Measurement:** `(Total Uptime / Total Time) * 100`
- **Target:** 99.9%
 Availability is measured by tracking the successful HTTP response codes (2xx, 3xx) from the application.

#### 3.2 Latency (Response Time)

- **Definition:** The time it takes for the application to respond to user requests.
- **Measurement:** The 95th percentile of response times for HTTP requests.
- **Target:** 95% of requests should be served within 200ms.
Latency is measured by tracking the response time of the application for different API endpoints.

#### 3.3 Error Rate

- **Definition:** The percentage of failed requests out of the total number of requests.
- **Measurement:** `(Number of Failed Requests / Total Requests) * 100`
- **Target:** Less than 0.1%
Error rate is measured by tracking the HTTP response codes indicating an error (4xx, 5xx).

#### 3.4 Throughput

- **Definition:** The number of transactions processed by the application per second.
- **Measurement:** Number of successful transactions per second. This is complementary to the error rate and tracks the success of user requests.
- **Target:** At least 500 transactions per second during peak hours.


#### 3.5 User Experience (UX)

- **Definition:** The percentage of users who successfully complete critical workflows without errors.
- **Measurement:** User completion rate for key workflows (e.g., account login, payment processing).
- **Target:** 99% successful completion rate.
Uptime is tracked using monitoring tools that ping the application at regular intervals.

### 4. Service Level Objectives (SLO)

The SLOs are the agreed-upon targets for the SLIs that define the acceptable level of service quality. The SLOs for the XYZ Customer Portal are as follows:

#### 4.1 Availability SLO

- **Objective:** The application should have an availability of **99.95%** over a rolling 30-day window.
- **Reasoning:** High availability is critical for user satisfaction, particularly during peak usage times.

#### 4.2 Latency SLO

- **Objective:** 95% of all HTTP requests should have a response time of less than 200ms over a rolling 30-day period.
- **Reasoning:** Fast response times are essential for a good user experience, especially for time-sensitive operations. 

#### 4.3 Error Rate SLO

- **Objective:** The error rate for the XYZ Customer Portal should not exceed 0.1% of all requests over a rolling 30-day period.
- **Reasoning:** Minimizing errors ensures a smooth user experience and maintains trust in the application.

#### 4.4 Throughput SLO (Uptime SLO)

- **Objective:** The application must handle at least 500 transactions per second during peak hours (9 AM - 6 PM UTC) over a rolling 30-day period.
- **Reasoning:** Ensuring high uptime during business hours is crucial for customer-facing services.

#### 4.5 Request Success Rate SLO (User Experience SLO)

- **Objective:** 99% of users should successfully complete critical workflows without errors over a rolling 30-day period.
- **Reasoning:** A high request success rate indicates reliable application performance and user satisfaction.

### 5. Monitoring and Reporting

**Tools and Reporting**: SLIs are monitored continuously using XYZ Corp's monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana). The report on SLOs compliance are reviewed monthly, and a report is generated that includes the following:
    - SLI performance against SLO targets
    - Incident reports for any SLO breaches
    - Recommendations for improving service reliability
- **Alerting:** Automated alerts will be triggered if any SLO is breached, with a defined escalation path for resolution.

### 6. Incident Management

If any SLO is breached, the following steps will be taken:

1. **Incident Response:** Immediate investigation by the SRE team.
2. **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify the underlying cause of the breach.
3. **Corrective Actions:** Implement fixes or workarounds to prevent recurrence.
4. **Communication:** Inform stakeholders about the breach, impact, and resolution steps.

### 7. Review and Revision

- **Frequency:** This document will be reviewed quarterly or after any significant changes to the service architecture. Updates to SLOs and SLIs may be made based on service performance, user feedback, and business needs.
- **Stakeholders:** The review will involve representatives from the DevOps, Product, and Customer Support teams.

### 8. SLO Breach Response Protocol

This section outlines the specific steps and escalation paths to be followed in the event of an SLO breach.

#### 8.1 Escalation Path

- **Tier 1:** On-call SRE team immediately investigates the issue.
- **Tier 2:** If unresolved within 30 minutes, escalate to the senior SRE.
- **Tier 3:** If unresolved within 2 hours, escalate to the Engineering Manager and notify the CTO.

#### 8.2 Communication Protocol

- **Internal:** Notify all relevant stakeholders (e.g., product team, support team) immediately.
- **External:** If the breach affects users, issue a status update on the public status page and notify affected customers via email.

#### 8.3 Post-Mortem Process

- **Timeline:** A detailed post-mortem report should be completed within 48 hours of the incident.
- **Content:** The report should include a root cause analysis, impact assessment, corrective actions, and any updates to the SLO/SLI document.

### 9. SLO Review and Adjustment Criteria

Explain the process for reviewing and potentially adjusting SLOs based on evolving service needs.

#### 9.1 Review Frequency

- **Quarterly Review:** SLOs will be reviewed quarterly to assess their relevance and effectiveness.
- **Trigger-Based Review:** An SLO review may be triggered by significant changes in user behavior, architecture, or business objectives.

#### 9.2 Criteria for Adjustment

- **Performance Trends:** If SLIs consistently meet or exceed SLOs by a large margin, the SLOs may be tightened.
- **Business Impact:** If new business goals or priorities arise, SLOs may be adjusted to align with these objectives.
- **Customer Feedback:** SLOs may be adjusted based on direct feedback from customers regarding their experience.

### 10. Tooling and Automation

List the tools and automation practices used to monitor, alert, and report on SLIs.

#### 10.1 Monitoring Tools

- **Prometheus:** For collecting and querying SLI data.
- **Grafana:** For visualizing SLI performance against SLOs.
- **New Relic:** For application performance monitoring.

#### 10.2 Alerting Mechanisms

- **PagerDuty:** For on-call alerting in case of SLO breaches.
- **Slack Integration:** To push real-time alerts and status updates to the engineering team's Slack channel.

#### 10.3 Automation Practices

- **Automated Remediation:** Scripts and playbooks for automated response to common incidents.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Automated deployment of fixes and performance improvements.

### 11. Risks and Assumptions

Identify any risks and assumptions that could affect the SLOs.

#### 11.1 Risks

- **Infrastructure Dependency:** SLOs assume 99.99% uptime for AWS services (e.g., EC2, RDS).
- **Third-Party Integrations:** SLOs assume stable performance from third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, APIs).

#### 11.2 Assumptions

- **User Traffic:** SLOs are based on the assumption of a maximum of 1,000 concurrent users.
