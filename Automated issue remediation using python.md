Let's consider a critical real-time production issue: **"Database Connection Pool Exhaustion."**

### Scenario:
Your production service relies on a database, and under heavy load, the application starts exhausting the available database connections from the connection pool. This leads to failed transactions, increased latency, and potential service downtime.

### Automated Remediation Script

#### 1. **Issue Detection:**
   - The script will monitor the application logs or database metrics for signs that the connection pool is being exhausted.

#### 2. **Automated Remediation:**
   - When the issue is detected, the script will attempt to remediate the problem by:
     - Restarting the application service to clear the connection pool.
     - Scaling up the application instances to distribute the load.
     - Temporarily redirecting traffic to another instance or reducing the load by modifying the load balancer.

#### 3. **Notification and Escalation:**
   - After attempting remediation, the script will notify the on-call engineer. If the issue persists after remediation attempts, the script will escalate the incident.

### Example Script in Python:

```python
import subprocess
import requests
import time
from slack_sdk import WebClient

# Configurations
LOG_FILE = "/var/log/app.log"
DB_METRIC_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:8080/metrics/db"
SLACK_TOKEN = "your-slack-token"
SLACK_CHANNEL = "#incident-response"
ESCALATION_THRESHOLD = 3  # Number of remediation attempts before escalation

# Slack Client
slack_client = WebClient(token=SLACK_TOKEN)

def send_slack_notification(message):
    response = slack_client.chat_postMessage(channel=SLACK_CHANNEL, text=message)
    return response['ok']

def restart_service(service_name):
    subprocess.run(["sudo", "systemctl", "restart", service_name])
    print(f"{service_name} restarted.")

def scale_up_instances():
    # Simulate scaling up instances
    print("Scaling up instances...")
    time.sleep(10)
    print("Instances scaled up.")

def check_db_metrics():
    response = requests.get(DB_METRIC_ENDPOINT)
    data = response.json()
    return data['db_connection_pool_used'], data['db_connection_pool_max']

def handle_connection_pool_exhaustion():
    attempts = 0
    while attempts < ESCALATION_THRESHOLD:
        used_connections, max_connections = check_db_metrics()
        
        if used_connections >= max_connections:
            attempts += 1
            print(f"Connection pool exhaustion detected: {used_connections}/{max_connections} used.")
            
            # Attempt remediation
            restart_service("application_service")
            scale_up_instances()
            send_slack_notification(f"Attempted remediation for connection pool exhaustion. Attempt {attempts}/{ESCALATION_THRESHOLD}.")
            
            # Recheck after remediation
            time.sleep(60)  # Wait a minute to see if the issue persists
        else:
            print("Connection pool levels are normal.")
            break
    
    if attempts == ESCALATION_THRESHOLD:
        send_slack_notification("Escalation: Connection pool exhaustion persists after multiple remediation attempts.")
        escalate_incident("Connection pool exhaustion requires manual intervention.")

def escalate_incident(reason):
    # Simulate escalation
    print(f"Incident escalated: {reason}")
    send_slack_notification(f"Incident escalated: {reason}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Continuous monitoring
    while True:
        handle_connection_pool_exhaustion()
        time.sleep(300)  # Check every 5 minutes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Configuration:**
   - `LOG_FILE`: Path to the log file to monitor (if needed).
   - `DB_METRIC_ENDPOINT`: Endpoint to retrieve database metrics (assumed to be exposed by the application).
   - `SLACK_TOKEN` and `SLACK_CHANNEL`: Slack token and channel to send notifications.
   - `ESCALATION_THRESHOLD`: Number of remediation attempts before escalating the issue.

2. **Detection Logic:**
   - The script checks database metrics periodically to see if the connection pool is nearing exhaustion.

3. **Remediation Steps:**
   - **Service Restart**: The script attempts to restart the service to free up connections.
   - **Scaling Up Instances**: It simulates scaling up the number of instances to handle the increased load.

4. **Notification:**
   - The script sends notifications to a Slack channel each time it attempts remediation and if escalation is needed.

5. **Escalation:**
   - If remediation attempts fail, the script escalates the issue by notifying the team that manual intervention is required.

### Enhancements:
- **Integration with a Load Balancer API**: The script could automatically adjust load balancer settings or redirect traffic to a less-loaded instance.
- **More Granular Control**: The script could integrate with cloud APIs (like AWS, GCP) to dynamically scale resources, adjust database configurations, or even trigger a failover to a backup database.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: For more sophisticated systems, ML models could predict connection pool exhaustion based on historical data, and the script could proactively scale resources or optimize queries before issues arise.

Here are five more examples of real-time critical issues in a production service, along with corresponding automated remediation scripts in Python:

### 1. **High CPU Usage on Application Servers**

#### Scenario:
Under heavy load, your application servers experience high CPU usage, which leads to slow response times or unresponsive services.

#### Automated Remediation Script:

```python
import subprocess
import requests
import psutil
from slack_sdk import WebClient

# Configurations
CPU_THRESHOLD = 85  # Threshold for CPU usage in percentage
SLACK_TOKEN = "your-slack-token"
SLACK_CHANNEL = "#incident-response"

# Slack Client
slack_client = WebClient(token=SLACK_TOKEN)

def send_slack_notification(message):
    response = slack_client.chat_postMessage(channel=SLACK_CHANNEL, text=message)
    return response['ok']

def scale_up_instances():
    # Simulate scaling up instances
    print("Scaling up instances due to high CPU usage...")
    time.sleep(10)
    print("Instances scaled up.")

def check_cpu_usage():
    return psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)

def handle_high_cpu_usage():
    cpu_usage = check_cpu_usage()
    if cpu_usage > CPU_THRESHOLD:
        print(f"High CPU usage detected: {cpu_usage}%.")
        
        # Attempt remediation
        scale_up_instances()
        send_slack_notification(f"Attempted remediation for high CPU usage. Current usage: {cpu_usage}%")
        
        # Recheck after remediation
        time.sleep(60)  # Wait a minute to see if the issue persists
        if check_cpu_usage() > CPU_THRESHOLD:
            escalate_incident("High CPU usage persists after remediation.")

def escalate_incident(reason):
    # Simulate escalation
    print(f"Incident escalated: {reason}")
    send_slack_notification(f"Incident escalated: {reason}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Continuous monitoring
    while True:
        handle_high_cpu_usage()
        time.sleep(300)  # Check every 5 minutes
```

### 2. **Disk Space Exhaustion**

#### Scenario:
Your application server's disk is running out of space, which can cause services to crash or logs to stop being written.

#### Automated Remediation Script:

```python
import shutil
import subprocess
import os
from slack_sdk import WebClient

# Configurations
DISK_THRESHOLD = 90  # Threshold for disk usage in percentage
LOG_DIR = "/var/log"
SLACK_TOKEN = "your-slack-token"
SLACK_CHANNEL = "#incident-response"

# Slack Client
slack_client = WebClient(token=SLACK_TOKEN)

def send_slack_notification(message):
    response = slack_client.chat_postMessage(channel=SLACK_CHANNEL, text=message)
    return response['ok']

def check_disk_usage():
    total, used, free = shutil.disk_usage("/")
    return (used / total) * 100

def clear_old_logs(directory, days=7):
    find_command = f"find {directory} -type f -mtime +{days} -exec rm -f {{}} \;"
    subprocess.run(find_command, shell=True)
    print("Old logs cleared.")

def handle_disk_space_exhaustion():
    disk_usage = check_disk_usage()
    if disk_usage > DISK_THRESHOLD:
        print(f"High disk usage detected: {disk_usage}%.")

        # Attempt remediation
        clear_old_logs(LOG_DIR)
        send_slack_notification(f"Attempted remediation for high disk usage. Current usage: {disk_usage}%")
        
        # Recheck after remediation
        time.sleep(60)  # Wait a minute to see if the issue persists
        if check_disk_usage() > DISK_THRESHOLD:
            escalate_incident("High disk usage persists after remediation.")

def escalate_incident(reason):
    # Simulate escalation
    print(f"Incident escalated: {reason}")
    send_slack_notification(f"Incident escalated: {reason}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Continuous monitoring
    while True:
        handle_disk_space_exhaustion()
        time.sleep(300)  # Check every 5 minutes
```

### 3. **Memory Leak in Application**

#### Scenario:
A memory leak in your application is causing it to consume more and more memory over time, eventually leading to crashes or severe performance degradation.

#### Automated Remediation Script:

```python
import psutil
import subprocess
from slack_sdk import WebClient

# Configurations
MEMORY_THRESHOLD = 90  # Threshold for memory usage in percentage
SERVICE_NAME = "application_service"
SLACK_TOKEN = "your-slack-token"
SLACK_CHANNEL = "#incident-response"

# Slack Client
slack_client = WebClient(token=SLACK_TOKEN)

def send_slack_notification(message):
    response = slack_client.chat_postMessage(channel=SLACK_CHANNEL, text=message)
    return response['ok']

def check_memory_usage():
    memory_info = psutil.virtual_memory()
    return memory_info.percent

def restart_service(service_name):
    subprocess.run(["sudo", "systemctl", "restart", service_name])
    print(f"{service_name} restarted.")

def handle_memory_leak():
    memory_usage = check_memory_usage()
    if memory_usage > MEMORY_THRESHOLD:
        print(f"High memory usage detected: {memory_usage}%.")

        # Attempt remediation
        restart_service(SERVICE_NAME)
        send_slack_notification(f"Attempted remediation for high memory usage. Current usage: {memory_usage}%")
        
        # Recheck after remediation
        time.sleep(60)  # Wait a minute to see if the issue persists
        if check_memory_usage() > MEMORY_THRESHOLD:
            escalate_incident("High memory usage persists after remediation.")

def escalate_incident(reason):
    # Simulate escalation
    print(f"Incident escalated: {reason}")
    send_slack_notification(f"Incident escalated: {reason}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Continuous monitoring
    while True:
        handle_memory_leak()
        time.sleep(300)  # Check every 5 minutes
```

### 4. **Database Latency Spike**

#### Scenario:
The database starts experiencing high latency, causing slow queries and impacting the performance of the entire application.

#### Automated Remediation Script:

```python
import subprocess
import requests
from slack_sdk import WebClient

# Configurations
DB_LATENCY_THRESHOLD = 200  # Threshold for DB latency in milliseconds
DB_METRIC_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:8080/metrics/db"
SLACK_TOKEN = "your-slack-token"
SLACK_CHANNEL = "#incident-response"

# Slack Client
slack_client = WebClient(token=SLACK_TOKEN)

def send_slack_notification(message):
    response = slack_client.chat_postMessage(channel=SLACK_CHANNEL, text=message)
    return response['ok']

def check_db_latency():
    response = requests.get(DB_METRIC_ENDPOINT)
    data = response.json()
    return data['db_latency']

def restart_db_service():
    subprocess.run(["sudo", "systemctl", "restart", "database_service"])
    print("Database service restarted.")

def handle_db_latency_spike():
    db_latency = check_db_latency()
    if db_latency > DB_LATENCY_THRESHOLD:
        print(f"High database latency detected: {db_latency}ms.")

        # Attempt remediation
        restart_db_service()
        send_slack_notification(f"Attempted remediation for high database latency. Current latency: {db_latency}ms")
        
        # Recheck after remediation
        time.sleep(60)  # Wait a minute to see if the issue persists
        if check_db_latency() > DB_LATENCY_THRESHOLD:
            escalate_incident("High database latency persists after remediation.")

def escalate_incident(reason):
    # Simulate escalation
    print(f"Incident escalated: {reason}")
    send_slack_notification(f"Incident escalated: {reason}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Continuous monitoring
    while True:
        handle_db_latency_spike()
        time.sleep(300)  # Check every 5 minutes
```

### 5. **Network Latency or Packet Loss**

#### Scenario:
Your application experiences network latency or packet loss, which leads to slow responses, timeouts, or connection failures.

#### Automated Remediation Script:

```python
import subprocess
import requests
from slack_sdk import WebClient

# Configurations
PING_TARGET = "8.8.8.8"  # External IP to ping for latency checks
LATENCY_THRESHOLD = 100  # Latency threshold in milliseconds
PACKET_LOSS_THRESHOLD = 5  # Packet loss threshold in percentage
SLACK_TOKEN = "your-slack-token"
SLACK_CHANNEL = "#incident-response"

# Slack Client
slack_client = WebClient(token=SLACK_TOKEN)

def send_slack_notification(message):
    response = slack_client.chat_postMessage(channel=SLACK_CHANNEL, text=message)
    return response['ok']

def check_network_latency():
    ping_response = subprocess.run(["ping", "-c", "4", PING_TARGET], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
    output = ping_response.stdout
    latency = None
    packet_loss = None
    
    for line in output.split("\n"):
        if "avg" in line:
            latency = float(line.split("/")[4])
        if "packet loss" in line:
            packet_loss = float(line.split("%")[0].split()[-1])
    
    return latency, packet_loss

def handle_network_issue():
    latency, packet_loss = check_network_latency()
    if latency and packet_loss:
        if latency > LATENCY_THRESHOLD or packet_loss > PACKET_LOSS_THRESHOLD:
            print(f"Network issue detected: Latency={latency}ms, Packet Loss={packet_loss}%.")

            # Attempt remediation: Restart networking service
            subprocess.run(["sudo", "systemctl", "restart", "networking"])
            send_sl
```

This automation script helps in reducing downtime and improves response time during critical incidents, ensuring that the service remains operational even under high load conditions.
