Developing SLIs (Service Level Indicators) and SLOs (Service Level Objectives) from scratch involves a systematic approach and involves different roles within the organization. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to develop them and the responsibilities of different roles:

### 1. **Identify Key Metrics**

**Responsibilities:**
- **Product Owners/Managers**: Define the critical aspects of the service that impact user experience. They should understand customer needs and business objectives.
- **SREs/DevOps Engineers**: Provide input on what metrics are technically feasible to measure and monitor.

**Steps:**
- **Understand User Needs**: Determine what aspects of the service are most important to users (e.g., response time, availability, error rates).
- **Define Metrics**: Choose metrics that align with user needs and business goals. Common metrics include latency, error rate, availability, throughput, etc.

### 2. **Define Service Level Indicators (SLIs)**

**Responsibilities:**
- **SREs/DevOps Engineers**: Specify the exact measurements and how they will be collected.
- **Product Owners/Managers**: Ensure that SLIs reflect user expectations and business requirements.

**Steps:**
- **Choose Appropriate SLIs**: Select metrics that directly reflect service performance from the user's perspective.
- **Measure and Collect Data**: Implement monitoring tools to collect data for the chosen SLIs.

### 3. **Set Service Level Objectives (SLOs)**

**Responsibilities:**
- **Product Owners/Managers**: Define the acceptable thresholds for each SLI based on business requirements and customer expectations.
- **SREs/DevOps Engineers**: Provide input on technical feasibility and constraints. Ensure that SLOs are achievable based on current system capabilities.

**Steps:**
- **Determine Target Values**: Based on historical data and user expectations, set target values or ranges for each SLI.
- **Establish Baselines**: Use historical performance data to establish realistic and achievable SLOs.

### 4. **Calculate Error Budgets**

**Responsibilities:**
- **SREs/DevOps Engineers**: Calculate and monitor error budgets based on SLOs and actual performance.
- **Product Owners/Managers**: Use error budgets to make informed decisions about balancing reliability with new features or changes.

**Steps:**
- **Define the Error Budget**: Calculate the allowable error rate or downtime based on the SLO. For example, if the SLO is 99.9% uptime, the error budget is 0.1% downtime.
- **Monitor Usage**: Track the error budget consumption to make data-driven decisions about service improvements or feature releases.

### 5. **Implement Monitoring and Reporting**

**Responsibilities:**
- **SREs/DevOps Engineers**: Implement and maintain monitoring systems to track SLIs and SLOs. Ensure accurate and timely reporting.
- **Product Owners/Managers**: Review reports to ensure alignment with business goals and user needs.

**Steps:**
- **Set Up Monitoring Tools**: Deploy tools and dashboards to continuously monitor SLIs and track SLO compliance.
- **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review performance against SLOs and adjust as necessary based on changing requirements or system performance.

### 6. **Communicate and Review**

**Responsibilities:**
- **All Stakeholders**: Collaborate to review SLIs and SLOs periodically and adjust based on performance and evolving needs.

**Steps:**
- **Communicate SLOs**: Share SLOs with relevant teams to ensure alignment and understanding.
- **Review and Iterate**: Periodically review and adjust SLIs and SLOs based on performance data, user feedback, and changes in business objectives.

### Summary

- **Product Owners/Managers**: Focus on user needs and business goals to define SLIs and set SLOs.
- **SREs/DevOps Engineers**: Handle the technical implementation, measurement, and monitoring of SLIs, and calculate and track error budgets.
- **All Stakeholders**: Collaborate on the review and adjustment of SLIs and SLOs to ensure they remain relevant and achievable.

By following these steps and clearly defining responsibilities, you can effectively develop and manage SLIs and SLOs to ensure service reliability and meet user expectations.
