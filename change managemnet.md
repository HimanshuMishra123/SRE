Change management is a process used to ensure that changes to the IT system or processes are made smoothly and effectively without disrupting services. Here’s a simple breakdown:

1. **Planning**: Before making a change (like updating software or modifying configurations of system or deploying new hardware), plan out what needs to be done, why it’s necessary, and how it will be executed.
Identify what changes are needed and how they will impact your system or business. This includes detailing the change, setting objectives, and risks assessment

2. **Approval**: Changes often need to be reviewed and approved by stakeholders or a change advisory board(CAB) to ensure they are necessary and won’t negatively impact the system. This ensures everyone is aware of and agrees with the planned change.

3. **Communication**: Inform all affected parties about the change, including when it will happen, what to expect, and any actions they may need to take.

4. **Implementation**: Execute the change according to the approved plan, following any procedures to minimize risk and disruption.

5. **Testing**: Test the change in a controlled environment before applying it to the live system. This helps catch any issues early and ensures that the change won’t negatively impact the existing system.

6. **Monitoring**: After implementation, monitor the system to ensure the change is working as expected and doesn’t cause new problems.

7. **Documentation**: Record the details of the change, including the planning, approval, implementation, and any issues encountered. This helps in future audits and provides a reference for similar changes.

8. **Review**: After the change has been in place for a while, review its effectiveness and impact. This helps in understanding if the change met its goals and if there are any lessons learned for future changes.


**In short Change management helps make sure that changes are made in a controlled, systematically, with minimal risk and disruption to services and predictable way to avoid problems and ensure smooth operations.**
