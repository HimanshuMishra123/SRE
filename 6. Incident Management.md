### Incident Management Process 

#### 1. **Recursive Separation of Responsibilities**
- **Clear role separation** ensures focus and prevents overlap in tasks.
- Each team member knows their specific responsibilities, which allows autonomy and accountability.
- **Delegation** is key when workload exceeds capacity. New subincidents or tasks can be assigned.

#### 2. **Incident Roles**
Several core roles ensure proper handling of the incident:

- **Incident Command (Commander)**:
   - Oversees the incident and assigns roles.
   - Holds any roles not yet delegated.
   - Removes roadblocks for the Ops team, ensuring efficiency.

- **Operational Work (Ops Lead)**:
   - Works closely with the incident commander to modify the system.
   - The only team allowed to make system changes during the incident.

- **Communication Lead**:
   - Acts as the public face of the incident response team.
   - Provides updates to stakeholders and team members.
   - May maintain the **Incident State Document**.

- **Planning Role**:
   - Supports Ops by addressing non-urgent issues like task management and tracking system deviations.
   - Tracks deviations from the norm for post-incident reversion.

#### 3. **Recognized Command Post**
- **Centralized Communication**: Teams can use `Slack` or IRC(old tool, lacks advance features) or similar tools to keep everyone updated.
   - Slack logs provide a record of incident-related communications, vital for postmortems.
   - Bots can log alerts, making it easier to track actions and events.

#### 4. **Live Incident State Document**
- **Living Documentation**: Maintained by the incident commander.
   - Should be easily editable by multiple people (Google Docs or a wiki is common).
   - Essential for tracking real-time updates, actions, and decisions.
   - Use a template for consistency; keep critical information at the top.

---

#### 5. **Clear, Live Handoff**
- Handoffs should be explicit and documented. The new commander must fully understand the state of the incident.
   - **Clear statement of responsibility**: "You’re now the incident commander, okay?"
   - The handoff should be communicated to the team to avoid confusion.

---

#### 6. **When to Declare an Incident** : if any of the following is true, the event is an incident -
- Do you need to involve a second team in fixing the problem?
- Is the outage visible to customers?
- Is the issue unsolved even after an hour’s concentrated analysis?

#### 7. **Incident Management in Action (Scenario)**

#### 1. **Incident Detection**
- **Time**: 2 p.m.
- **Situation**: Mary receives an alert from her pager that a data center has stopped serving traffic.
- **Action**: Mary begins investigating the issue when a second alert indicates a second data center is also down. Mary decides to follow the `incident management framework`.

#### 2. **Delegation of Incident Command**
- **Action**: Mary asks Sabrina to take over as Incident Commander (IC).
- **Sabrina's Role**: 
  - Sabrina's Response: Agrees and quickly gathers initial details from Mary.
  - Sends an email to the prearranged incident response mailing list.
  - Sabrina begins maintaining the `live incident state document` with available information.
  (example of Incident state documet  https://sre.google/sre-book/incident-document/ )

#### 3. **Initial Assessment**
- **Action**: Sabrina asks Mary for an initial assessment.
- **Mary’s Response**: "Users are not yet impacted; the situation could worsen if a third datacenter goes down."
- **Sabrina’s Next Steps**:
  - Records the assessment in the `live incident state document`.
  - Monitors the situation for any further developments.

#### 4. **Third Alert and Update**
- **New Alert**: A third datacenter triggers an alert.
- **Action**: Sabrina sees the alert in Slack and updates the incident response email thread.
- **VP Notifications**: Sabrina ensures that VPs are informed of the high-level status without unnecessary details.
- **External Communications**: Sabrina asks the external communications rep to prepare user messaging in case the issue escalates further.

#### 5. **Involving Development Team**
- **Action**: Sabrina checks with Mary to see if the developer on-call, Josephine, should be looped in.
- **Mary’s Approval**: Sabrina brings Josephine into the incident response process.

#### 6. **Assigning Additional Support**
- **Action**: Robin volunteers to assist Mary and Josephine.
- **Sabrina’s Reminder**: 
  - Sabrina reminds Robin and Josephine to prioritize tasks delegated by Mary.
  - Both familiarize themselves with the live incident document for current updates.

#### 7. **Attempted Fix and Status Update**
- **Action**: Mary attempts to fix the issue by using an old binary release, but it doesn’t work.
- **Sabrina’s Update**: Robin logs the failure in Slack, and Sabrina updates the live incident management document.

#### 8. **Staff Handover Preparation**
- **Time**: 5 p.m.
- **Action**: Sabrina begins looking for replacement staff as the team prepares to hand off the incident to the sister office.
- **Phone Conference**: At 5:45, a brief phone meeting ensures that everyone is aware of the situation before the handoff.

#### 9. **Incident Handoff**
- **Time**: 6 p.m.
- **Action**: Sabrina and her colleagues hand off their responsibilities to the sister office for continued incident handling.

#### 10. **Post-Incident Wrap-Up**
- **Next Morning**: Mary returns to find the bug resolved, the incident closed, and postmortem work in progress.
- **Action**: Mary begins planning structural improvements to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.

Each of these steps highlights the importance of clear communication, delegation, and documentation in incident management, ensuring smooth transitions across different phases of incident resolution.

#### 8. **Practice and Regular Use**
- Regular use of the incident management framework is crucial to maintaining proficiency.
   - Apply the framework not only for actual incidents but also for change management across time zones.
   - Use the framework in **disaster recovery drills** and role-playing exercises to enhance readiness.

### Key Takeaways
- **Clear role definitions** prevent overlap and confusion.
- **Strong communication channels** (Slack, email) ensure up-to-date information sharing.
- **Live documentation and Slack** keeps everyone aligned and helps in postmortem analysis.
- Regular practice, even during non-urgent changes, keeps incident management skills sharp.

By setting up a **scalable, organized, and well-practiced process**, incident response becomes efficient and less stressful, contributing to faster recovery and overall reliability.
