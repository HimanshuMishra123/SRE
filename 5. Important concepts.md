**Some important one line terms/concepts in SRE :**

**Toil:** Toil in SRE refers to manual, repetitive, and automatable `work` that scales with service growth, hindering engineering efficiency and distracts from innovation. Reducing toil is crucial for improving system reliability and operational efficiency. Ideal is to automate the work or eliminate for better efficiency.
For example, manually restarting a server every time it crashes, instead of automating the process.

**White-box monitoring**: Monitoring based on metrics exposed by the internals of the system like CPU usage or application logs, offering insight into system behavior.  For example, monitoring an APIâ€™s response time.
**Black-box monitoring** : Testing externally visible behavior as a user would see it. Blackbox monitoring observes system output without knowing internals, like testing website uptime through HTTP requests.

**Page**: Page refers to an alert or notification sent to an engineer, typically when a `critical issue` occurs in a system. It requires immediate attention, often through a paging system like PagerDuty or Opsgenie, to ensure swift resolution of incidents affecting service availability.
When an `issue is not critical` , it typically results in a `lower priority alert` rather than a page. These alerts are logged or sent via `email, Slack, Jira ticket or dashboards` for later review. Non-critical issues don't require immediate action but should still be addressed during regular working hours to prevent them from escalating.

**On-call** in SRE means being available to handle incidents or issues that arise with a system. For example, if a website crashes at night, the on-call engineer will be paged to fix the problem, ensuring the site is back up and running smoothly. some popular tools for on-call management are `PagerDuty` and `Atlassian's Opsgenie`

**ad-hoc** refers to one-time or spontaneous actions taken to address issues or perform tasks outside regular processes. For example, if a sudden bug causes system downtime, an SRE might manually restart services to restore functionality quickly, instead of waiting for a scheduled fix.

**Release Engineering** in SRE involves managing and automating the deployment of software updates. For example, an SRE team use a `CI/CD pipeline` to automatically build, test, and deploy new versions of an application, ensuring consistency and reliability across environments while minimizing manual errors.

**Test-Induced Emergencies:** Problems can arise during testing, like load tests causing system issues. To prevent this, plan tests carefully, simulate real conditions, and monitor closely to catch issues early.<br/>
**Change-Induced Emergencies:** Changes to code or systems can cause problems if not managed well. Use thorough testing, feature flags for gradual changes, and have rollback plans. Document and review changes before applying them.<br/>
**Process-Induced Emergencies:** These come from weak operational processes. Improve by regularly reviewing and updating processes, learning from past incidents, and training your team. Clear documentation helps guide responses and prevent issues.<br/>
Overall, managing tests, changes, and processes carefully helps keep systems running smoothly and reduces emergencies.
