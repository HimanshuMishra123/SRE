SLI, SLO, and error budgets are key concepts in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) for managing and measuring the reliability of services. Here’s a quick overview of each:

### 1. **Service Level Indicator (SLI)**

- **Definition**: A metric that measures the performance of a service from the user’s perspective.
- **Examples**: Latency, error rate, uptime, availability.
- **Purpose**: SLIs are the raw data points that are used to gauge the quality of the service.

### 2. **Service Level Objective (SLO)**

- **Definition**: A target value or range for a service level indicator. It represents the desired level of reliability for a service.
- **Examples**: 99.9% uptime, less than 200 ms latency for 95% of requests.
- **Purpose**: SLOs help to set expectations and define what constitutes acceptable performance.

### 3. **Error Budget**

- **Definition**: The allowable threshold of error or downtime within a given time period, calculated as the difference between the target SLO and 100%.
- **Calculation**: If your SLO is 99.9% uptime, the error budget is 0.1% downtime.
- **Purpose**: The error budget provides a way to balance the risk of releasing new features or making changes against the reliability of the service. It allows teams to make informed decisions about how much reliability they can trade off for new functionality or experiments.

### Example Scenario:

- **SLI**: Average response time of API requests.
- **SLO**: 95th percentile response time must be under 200 ms.
- **Error Budget**: If the SLO is 99.9% uptime, then the error budget is 0.1% of the total time. In a month, that’s about 43 minutes of downtime.

By using SLIs, SLOs, and error budgets, SRE teams can effectively measure service reliability, set realistic performance targets, and manage trade-offs between reliability and new features.
