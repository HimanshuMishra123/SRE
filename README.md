**Devops vs SRE :** If someone is writing the new features of Instagram then devops is responsible in delivering the features to the end users as soon as possible by automating the developer operations in between while SRE is responsible for keeping the system available and reliable. If you watch Hot star during India Pakistan match you know the system is always available and reliable you not only see the match but you see the match with good quality output right every time someone is watching it you are sending a request to to it and you getting the response back reliably. 

For ideal monitoring setup(all open source tool) Here's a breakdown for different level of monitoring:

1. **Application-Level Monitoring (ELK Stack):** Using the ELK stack for application-level logging and monitoring is a solid choice. It allows you to aggregate logs, analyze them, and create dashboards for real-time insights.

2. **Kubernetes Network Monitoring (Kubeshark):** Kubeshark is great for deep packet inspection and network traffic analysis in Kubernetes. It’s a powerful tool for understanding network traffic and debugging issues.

3. **Kubernetes Cluster Monitoring (Prometheus+Grafana):** Prometheus is the go-to tool for Kubernetes cluster monitoring. It’s highly compatible with Kubernetes and provides powerful metrics collection and alerting capabilities.

4. **Network Latency Monitoring (eBPF):** eBPF is an advanced tool for  network latency monitoring, providing granular insights into network latency issues and other performance metrics at various layers (e.g., application, network, etc.). It’s a modern and efficient approach.<br/>
    `eBPF-based Tools` (e.g., Cilium, Pixie)<br/>
    **Overview:** eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a powerful technology in the Linux kernel that allows for high-performance monitoring and profiling. Tools like Cilium and Pixie use eBPF to provide deep visibility into network traffic.<br/>
    **Latency Monitoring:** These tools can monitor real-time network latency at the kernel level, offering detailed insights into latency issues at various layers (e.g., application, network, etc.).<br/>

This above setup covers key areas of monitoring across application, network, and infrastructure levels, aligning well with both DevOps and SRE practices.<br/>

### There are even better but paid tools like **splunk** and **dynatrace :**

**Splunk:** Could replace the ELK Stack and partially replace Prometheus.
**Dynatrace:** Could replace the ELK Stack, Prometheus, Kubeshark, and potentially your eBPF tool, providing a unified platform for monitoring.

If you are looking for a more consolidated and AI-driven monitoring solution, `Dynatrace` might be the better choice, as it can replace most of your current tools while offering enhanced capabilities. `Splunk` would be more focused on log management and analytics but would require retaining some existing tools like Prometheus etc. for metrics-specific use cases.
