**Monitoring in a production environment, especially in an SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) context, involves tracking a wide range of metrics across various layers of the infrastructure and applications. Here's a detailed breakdown of the metrics typically monitored at each stage in your setup, along with the incident management measures and standard operating procedures (SOPs) for resolving issues.**

**Steps when issue arises:**
Detect Problems: Set up alerts for errors and slowdowns.
Respond: Find out how serious the issue is, fix the problem, and possibly roll back recent changes or rerouting traffic, adjusting settings, or restarting components..
After the Incident : Document what happened, learn from it, and prevent it from happening again.

  - **P1**: Major issues causing partial service degradation, affecting critical functionalities, but not a full outage.
  - **P2**: Minor issues affecting a small subset of users or non-critical functionalities. Can be addressed during normal business hours.
  - **P3**: Cosmetic or minor issues with negligible impact on user experience or service performance. These are often logged for future consideration.

### **2. Runbooks and Playbooks**

- **Objective**: To conduct a thorough analysis of the incident, its impact, and the effectiveness of the response, aiming to prevent recurrence and improve future incident handling.
- **Steps**:
  - **Incident Summary**: Provide a brief overview of what happened, including the timeline of events, detection, response, and resolution.
  - **Impact Analysis**: Quantify the impact on users, services, and business metrics (e.g., downtime duration, financial impact, SLA breaches).
  - **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**: Conduct a detailed investigation to identify the underlying cause(s) of the incident.
  - **Corrective Actions**:
    - Identify what changes are necessary to prevent the incident from recurring (e.g., code changes, infrastructure adjustments, policy updates).
    - Assign ownership for implementing these changes, with clear deadlines.
  - **Lessons Learned**: Document any insights gained from the incident that could improve processes, tools, or team collaboration.
  - **Sharing**: Disseminate the PIR report across relevant teams and use it to update runbooks, playbooks, and monitoring configurations.

### **4. Continuous Improvement**
- **Monitoring and Alert Tuning**:
  - Regularly review and refine alert thresholds to reduce false positives and ensure timely detection of genuine issues.
  - Implement anomaly detection techniques to identify issues that do not trigger predefined alerts.

### **5. Documentation and Knowledge Sharing**
- **Comprehensive Documentation**:
  - Maintain detailed documentation of the entire monitoring setup, including architecture diagrams, metric definitions, and alert configurations.
  - Ensure all runbooks, playbooks, and SOPs are easily accessible and up-to-date.
- **Knowledge Sharing**:
  - Conduct regular training sessions to ensure all team members are familiar with monitoring tools, incident response procedures, and best practices.
  - Encourage a culture of continuous learning and improvement, where team members share insights from incidents and experiments.

## **Replacing Tools with Splunk or Dynatrace**
- **Splunk**:

  - **Custom Metrics**: Use Splunk to collect and analyze custom metrics via its integrations with various data sources and its ability to handle structured and unstructured data.

- **Dynatrace**:
  - **Kubernetes Monitoring**: Replace Prometheus with Dynatrace for enhanced Kubernetes monitoring, including automatic discovery, AI-driven root cause analysis, and real-time observability.
  - **Network Monitoring**: Dynatrace offers integrated network performance monitoring, which could replace Kubeshark, providing end-to-end visibility from the application layer down to the network layer.
  - **eBPF Integration**: Dynatrace has native support for eBPF, allowing you to replace standalone eBPF tools with its integrated observability platform for kernel-level metrics and tracing.
